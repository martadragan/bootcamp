    <h1>What can you learn from style guides? </h1>
    <article>
        <h3>Why should you care about how your code is formatted?</h3>
        <p>Because it's easier to read it for us and for other developers who use our code.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Should the code be lowercase or uppercase?</h3>
        <p>It depends on situation, but usually in HTML and CSS we use lowercase.</p>
        <h3>How many spaces should you intent at a time?</h3>
        <p>4</p>
        <h3>What is the recommended encoding?</h3>
        <p>UTF-8</p>
        <h3>How should you use comment to explain your code? How do you do it in HTML and in CSS?
        </h3>
        <p> HTML &lt;!-- comment --&gt; <br>
        CSS /* comment */ - we comment our code so other people find it easier to understand </p>
        <h3>How do you validate your HTML?</h3>
        <p>There are certain websites dedicated to it, like www.html5.validator.nu</p>
        <h3>What is the purpose of the alt attribute?</h3>
        <p>If the photo is" not" working it shows the simple description and also if we want to make our website easier to find we should use alt attribute</p>
        <h3>Should you separate structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior (scripting)? If yes, why? </h3>
        <p>Yes. Our code will be much cleaner.</p>
        <h3>Should you use double or single quotation marks around attribute values?
        </h3>
        <p>We can use both.</p>
        <h3>How can you validate your CSS code?
        </h3>
        <p>We can use websites, like https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</p>
        <h3>When would you use meaningful ID/class names? When would you use generic ones?
        </h3>
        <p>You should use meaningful ones most of the times,due to readability of the code, while the generic ones whe can use in a specific situations. </p>
