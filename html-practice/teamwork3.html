    <ol>
        <li>What is an IP address?
            <p>IP is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.</p>
        </li> 

        <li>What is a domain name?
            <p>It's the part of a network address which identifies it as belonging to a particular domain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>What is URL?
            <p>Stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It's a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. </p>
        </li> 
        <li>What is DNS?
            <p>Domain Name System. Is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
        </li> 
        <li>What is the difference between HTML and HTTP?
            <p>HTML is a language, HTTP is a protocol.</p>

        </li>
        <li>What is the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web?
            <p>The internet is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. The World Wide Web, or simply web, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the internet. </p>
        </li>
        <li>What is client and what is server?
            <p>Both “client” and “server” refer to computers that are used for different purposes. A client is a small computer that accesses a server through a network. </p>
        </li>
        <li>What is a web page?
            <p>It's a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers. A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device.</p>
        </li>
        <li>How do you register a domain name for your website?
            <p>Getting a domain name involves registering the name you want with an organisation called ICANN through a domain name registrar. For example, if you choose a name like "example.com", you will have to go to a registrar, pay a registration fee that costs around US$10 to US$35 for that name. That will give you the right to the name for a year, and you will have to renew it annually for (usually) the same amount per annum.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Where can you host a website?
            <p>More often than not, the term “web hosting” refers to the company that rent out their computer/servers to store your website and provide Internet connectivity so that other users can access to the files on your website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>What is HTTPS?
            <p>It's an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</p>
        </li>
        <li>What happens when you enter a URL such as www.facebook.com to your browser? Where does the Facebook web page come from and how does it arrive to your computer sitting on your desk?
            <p>You type www.facebook.com into the address bar of your browser. The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding IP address of the website we want to access. If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP’s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts www.facebook.com. Browser initiates a TCP connection with the server. The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. The server handles the request and sends back a response. The server sends out an HTTP response. The browser displays the HTML content (for HTML responses which is the most common). </p>
